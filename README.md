# Keylogger
Keylogger Simulation (Educational Purpose Only)

This project is a simple Python-based keylogger developed for **educational and ethical learning** in cybersecurity. 
It demonstrates how keystroke logging works in a controlled and safe environment using the pynput library.

Disclaimer: 
This tool is intended **ONLY for learning purposes**. 
Do not use it to record input on devices without the owner's knowledge and consent. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

Features:
